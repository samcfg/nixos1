# Encrypted secrets file
# This file will be encrypted with sops after you set up your age key

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Generate age key: nix-shell -p age --run "age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt"
# 2. Copy the PUBLIC key from output and add to ../.sops.yaml
# 3. Edit this file with: nix-shell -p sops --run "sops secrets/secrets.yaml"
# 4. Add your actual secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.)

# Example secrets (uncomment and add real values):
# sam-password: your-hashed-password-here
# nextcloud-admin-password: changeme
# nextcloud-db-password: changeme
# tailscale-auth-key: tskey-auth-xxxxx

# For password hashes, generate with:
# mkpasswd -m sha-512

# NOTE: This file is currently PLAINTEXT
# After running 'sops secrets/secrets.yaml', it will be encrypted
# Only then is it safe to commit to git
